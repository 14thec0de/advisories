## Description ##

Several Samsung Android smartphones expose a local socket, named "Multiclient",
that can be used by selected local applications to interact with RILD, the
Radio Interface Layer Daemon. Restrictions imposed by Samsung to limit access
to the "Multiclient" socket can be bypassed, permitting _any_ local application
to interact with RILD, with no constraints.

For a more detailed discussion of this bug and possible exploitation scenarios
